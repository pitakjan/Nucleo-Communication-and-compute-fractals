Program for computing fractal.
On a computer, the user can set fractal parameters which are instantly sent to Nucleo. 
Then choose where the fractal should be computed. On a computer (usually computed instantly) or on a Nucleo (takes about a minute, depending on the size of the fractal).
The Nucleo sends back only pixels of the final image.

Also supports interactive changing parameters and multiple animations. 

It is controlled only by a terminal on a computer.
