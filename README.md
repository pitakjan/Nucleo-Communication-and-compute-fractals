# Nucleo-Communication-and-compute-fractals

This program was a semestral work from CVUT, faculty of electrical engineering.
task assignor: prof. Ing. Jan Faigl, Ph.D.,

Program for computing fractal.
On a computer, the user can set fractal parameters which are instantly sent to Nucleo. 
Then choose where the fractal should be computed. On a computer (usually computed instantly) or on a Nucleo (takes about a minute, depending on the size of the fractal).
The Nucleo sends back only pixels of the final image.

The program has 2 parts.

For Nucleo and for computer.
It is controlled only by a terminal on a computer.
